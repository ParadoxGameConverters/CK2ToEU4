[h1]CK2 To EU4 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the CK2 to EU4 Converter project! The goal of this project is to transfer an existing a Crusader Kings 2 campaign into Europa Universalis 4, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 769 to 1821, and further using our other converters to Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron 4.

Running a continuous campaign from CK2 all the way to HoI4 is called running a [b]mega-campaign[/b].

[h2]Converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i][/h2]
[list]
[*] Converter currently supports CK2 3.3 and EU4 1.30. DLCs are optional.
[*] This mod is not intended to be enabled in game. It is only a [i]delivery vehicle[/i] for the converter's download link.
[*] You can also download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck2-to-eu4-converter-release-thread.1377860/]forums thread[/url] or from Github.
[/list]

[h3]Setting up the converter.[/h3]
To set up the converter, you’ll need to follow the simple steps below:
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to the this mod.
[*] If the mod does not immediately begin downloading, you may need to launch CK2 to trigger the download.
[*] Go to your mod folder (usually [i]C:\Users\YourUserName\My Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod[/i])
[*] Open [i]ck2toeu4.zip[/i], inside it find and open [i]downloadLink.txt[/i]. 
[*] Within that file are direct links to the converter's stable and development versions. Pick one and download it. Development versions are fresher and usually better.
[*] Unzip the downloaded converter by right-clicking on it and selecting [i]Extract All…[/i]
[*] Finally, go to the extracted converter's directory and fire it up by running [i]ConverterFrontend.exe[/i].
[/olist]

If you downloaded the converter directly from forums or github, you only need to execute steps 6 and 7.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/CK2_To_EU4_Converter]wiki page[/url].
Very generally, it takes your CK2 [b]saved game[/b] and converts it into an EU4 [b]mod[/b].
You then have to [b]add that mod[/b] to your mod playset in EU4's launcher:

[olist]
[*] Start the EU4 Launcher. Click [i]Mods[/i].
[*] Click [i]Manage Mods[/i].
[*] Click [i]Initial playset[/i] and select [i]Add new playset[/i] (or select the playset you're currently using).
[*] For a fresh playset, directly select the converted mod. Otherwise, on an existing playset in the bottom right corner click [i]Add more mods[/i] and add it.
[/olist]

[h2]Troubleshooting and Suggestions[/h2]

We are always open to suggestions on improving our converters and will gladly help you out if you hit a problem. 

Best place for discussion on improving the converters are our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck2-to-eu4-converter-release-thread.1377860/]Paradox forum release thread[/url] and [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck2-to-eu4-converter-development-thread.1377861/]development thread[/url].

When resolving issues we will always need your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion. Come to the release thread linked above and upload your log.txt there, along with a detailed description of your problem. We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.

Keep in mind Steam discussion below is [b]not suited[/b] to troubleshooting as you cannot upload files we need.
