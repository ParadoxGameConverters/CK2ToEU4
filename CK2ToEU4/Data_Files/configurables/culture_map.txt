# Usage:
# link = { ck2 = ck2culture eu4 = eu4culture region = eu4region province = eu4provinceID owner = eu4tag tech = techgroup gfx = somethinggfx }
# multiples of all except eu4, tech and gfx are allowed.
# Note: regions can be anything that makes sense, ie. south_america_superregion, north_german_region, laponia_area
# You can mix and match, ie. north_american_superregion + provinceid = 1240 will catch all of north america + hawaii.
# every culture should have a gfx set.
